### CI/CD with GitHub

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery). It's a set of practices and tools designed to improve the software development process by automating builds, testing, and deployment, enabling you to ship code changes faster and reliably.

* `Continuous integration (CI)`: Automatically builds, tests, and integrates code changes within a shared repository.

* `Continuous delivery (CD)`: automatically delivers code changes to production-ready environments for approval.

* `Continuous deployment (CD)`: automatically deploys code changes to customers directly.
