### CI/CD with GitHub

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery). It's a set of practices and tools designed to improve the software development process by automating builds, testing, and deployment, enabling you to ship code changes faster and reliably.

* `Continuous integration (CI)`: Automatically builds, tests, and integrates code changes within a shared repository.

* `Continuous delivery (CD)`: automatically delivers code changes to production-ready environments for approval.

* `Continuous deployment (CD)`: automatically deploys code changes to customers directly.

### AWS SAM Pipelines
A deployment pipeline is an automated sequence of steps that are performed to release a new version of an application. They are defined by a pipeline template file. AWS SAM Pipelines provides templates for popular CI/CD systems such as AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI/CD. Pipeline templates include AWS deployment best practices to help with multi-account and multi-Region deployments. AWS environments such as dev and production typically exist in different AWS accounts. This allows development teams to configure safe deployment pipelines, without making unintended changes to infrastructure. You can also supply your own custom pipeline templates to help to standardize pipelines across development teams. [[1]](#notes)

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy with the SAM CLI. It includes the following files and folders:

- `rust_app/Cargo.toml` - Project configuration file.
- `rust_app/src/main.rs` - Code for the application's Lambda function.
- `template.yaml` - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

The application uses several AWS resources, including Lambda functions and an API Gateway API. These resources are defined in the `template.yaml` file in this project. You can update the template to add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code.

If you prefer to use an integrated development environment (IDE) to build and test your application, you can use the AWS Toolkit.  
The AWS Toolkit is an open source plug-in for popular IDEs that uses the SAM CLI to build and deploy serverless applications on AWS. The AWS Toolkit also adds a simplified step-through debugging experience for Lambda function code. See the following links to get started.

### Requirements
* This template was tested with Rust v1.66.0 and above.

### Deploy the sample application

To deploy the application, you need the folllowing tools:

* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
* Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) version 1.64.0 or newer
* [cargo-lambda](https://github.com/cargo-lambda/cargo-lambda) for cross-compilation

To build and deploy your application for the first time, run the following in your shell:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy
```

The first command will build the source of your application. The second command will package and deploy your application to AWS with the default `samconfig.toml` in the project. Alternatively, you can run `sam deploy --guided` to deploy with a series of prompts:

* **Stack Name**: The name of the stack to deploy to CloudFormation. This should be unique to your account and region, and a good starting point would be something matching your project name.
* **AWS Region**: The AWS region you want to deploy your app to.
* **Confirm changes before deploy**: If set to yes, any change sets will be shown to you before execution for manual review. If set to no, the AWS SAM CLI will automatically deploy application changes.
* **Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation**: Many AWS SAM templates, including this example, create AWS IAM roles required for the AWS Lambda function(s) included to access AWS services. By default, these are scoped down to minimum required permissions. To deploy an AWS CloudFormation stack which creates or modifies IAM roles, the `CAPABILITY_IAM` value for `capabilities` must be provided. If permission isn't provided through this prompt, to deploy this example you must explicitly pass `--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM` to the `sam deploy` command.
* **Save arguments to `samconfig.toml`**: If set to yes, your choices will be saved to a configuration file inside the project, so that in the future you can just re-run `sam deploy` without parameters to deploy changes to your application.

You can find your API Gateway Endpoint URL in the output values displayed after deployment.

### Add a resource to your application
The application template uses AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to define application resources. AWS SAM is an extension of AWS CloudFormation with a simpler syntax for configuring common serverless application resources such as functions, triggers, and APIs. For resources not included in [the SAM specification](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md), you can use standard [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) resource types.

### Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
sam-app$ sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name sam-app --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

### Tests

Tests are defined alongside your lambda function code in the `rust_app/src` folder.

```bash
cargo test
```


### Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
sam delete
```

### Resources

See the [AWS SAM developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) for an introduction to SAM specification, the SAM CLI, and serverless application concepts.

Next, you can use AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy ready-to-use apps that go beyond hello world samples and learn how authors developed their applications: [AWS Serverless Application Repository main page](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/).
